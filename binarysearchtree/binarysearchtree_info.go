package binarysearchtree

/*
	We have a root and under the root left & right we have also children.
	At the bottom side nodes dont have new childer. So we say them 'leaves'.
	In binary tree, smaller child is placed on the left, and a larger placed on the right.

	When we insert a node, we compare to start at the root, and compare each other nodes and after placed it.
	Also when we search a node in BST we do same process do like in the insert process.

	The adventage of using Binary Tree is speed.
	 When tree is well balanced and when we search or insert data into a binary search tree the Big(O) is going to be O(h).
	  Which better than the O(N).
	   In the worst case scenario it would still be linar which would be equivalent to a linked list so a BST would be pretty useful.
